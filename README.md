Step to get it working
<br>-download as .zip, extract the files, in File Explorer go to the Path Bar and do 'cmd' to open the Command Prompt, in there do `npm init --y` it will download the package.json file, then download the list here `npm i discord.js colors express figlet got moment mongoose ms ms-prettify @discordjs/opus @distube/spotify ffmpeg-static libsodium-wrappers yt-search ytdl-core` and it should download all the packages needed, if not do them one by one
<br>-get your bots token and put it in the config.json file, go to [Discord Deveolper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to get the token and invite it to your server to test it
<br>-once its in your server, right click on the bot to get the ID, if you cant see it go to, User Settings > Advance > Deveolper Mode, tuirn that on, same thing with the guild (server) but it wont get used but put it in anyways. to catch all the errors put in a bot log channel ID, last for the IDs put in yours to use all commands even the ones are blocked for everyone
<br>-now you can setup MongoDB [Watch This Video](https://youtu.be/sng1vw9l7J0) to setup MongoDB and you will need to setup ffmpeg on your pc [Watching This Video](https://youtu.be/IECI72XEox0) tp setup ffmpeg
